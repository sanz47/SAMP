The Student's Academic Management Project is a project which focuses on administering the basic information of a student and the matters associated with it. Every day we feel the necessity to know various data regarding our academic lives, such as our current academic status, records, grades, classes, and so on. But we often face challenges to satisfy these necessities as itâ€™s a very laborious task to fetch this information whenever we need it, especially when it is scattered all over the place. For instance, if students want to know their current grade in a particular course, they have to fetch all their marks from the evaluations they have attended, make some complicated calculations, consider the credit for that course, and whatnot. This process is not only problematic but also very error-prone. 
Moreover, this project is not only for the students but also for the teachers and administrative members. A teacher can monitor a student's progress and improvement by analyzing their detailed academic status. Again, an administrator can easily amend and manage various information about both the teachers and the students.
So, the goal of our project is to make all this information effortlessly accessible to the administrators, students, and teachers.
